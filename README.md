# Emotion Recognition System
Created a machine learning model that can recognize human emotions from facial
expressions. Use image processing and deep learning techniques to train the model
on labeled emotion datasets.

Emotion recognition technology holds significant potential to revolutionize various
fields. By enabling machines to identify and understand human emotions, it opens
avenues for enhanced human-computer interaction, personalized experiences, and
improved mental health support. Emotion recognition can enhance user interfaces,
making devices more intuitive and responsive.

It can aid in marketing and customer service by gauging customer sentiment and
satisfaction. In healthcare, it can assist in diagnosing and treating mental health
conditions. Moreover, emotion recognition technology can contribute to building
empathetic AI systems, fostering emotional connections, and promoting overall
well-being in our increasingly digital world.

# Expected Outcomes-
The expected outcomes of the project include:
1. Development of an emotion recognition model capable of accurately
classifying human emotions based on the preprocessed data.
2. Evaluation of the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as
accuracy, precision.
3. Documentation of the project, including details of data preprocessing,
algorithm selection, and model development process.
